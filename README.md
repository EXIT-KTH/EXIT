## What is EXIT?

EXIT is an application built to connect students and examiners for degree projects at Kungliga Tekniska HÃ¶gskolan.  

## How to run EXIT

To start the application you need to have access to your server that is to host the application. From the repository directory on the server you can run the following commands:

### `npm start`

Starts the application on port 8080 on the host server. <br />

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />

As the server was set up by the original developers these scripts will run when a developer pushes to the master repository. It utilizes webhooks to achieve this. 

For information on how the application works see the documentation on the wiki.
